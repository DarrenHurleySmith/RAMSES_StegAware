Description
This forensic and steganalytic framework provides comprehensive analysis over image and video media and is part of the RAMSES platform. StegAware is a steganalysis tool for multimedia content (image and video) capable of detecting a diverse range of steganographic tools and techniques. The image steganalysis component of this framework uses the Java tool, StegExpose for LSB steganalysis and a series of signature detection methods. The video steganalytic feature of the tool uses signature steganalysis to cover a range of well-known video steganography tools. A feature for metadata forensics has been integrated to provide investigative details. In addition, the tool can integrate with the RAMSES platform and manage resources from its interface.
